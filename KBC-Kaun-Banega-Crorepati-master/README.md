## Limitations üöß 


Despite of the best effort of the developer, the following limitations and functional boundaries are visible, which limits the scope of this project:

- This software fails to retrieve random questions from the internet and instead only works with the 40 questions stored in the dictionary.
- If the user does not provide his/her name at the start, the software must be restarted.
- If an audio question appears, we cannot hear the timer sound, but the timer continues to run, and the audio continues to play until it ends.
